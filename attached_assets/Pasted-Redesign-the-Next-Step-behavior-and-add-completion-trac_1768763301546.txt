Redesign the “Next Step” behavior and add completion tracking across the entire Product Configuration workflow.

1) Change “Next Step” button behavior
- The “Next Step” button must NOT navigate to Home.
- “Back to Home” already covers that action.
- “Next Step” must advance the workflow to the next stage: submit the proposal to the approval flow (Under Evaluation).
- On click (when enabled), update proposal status from “On Going” to “Under Evaluation” and navigate to the appropriate confirmation or next screen in the workflow.

2) Enable/disable rules for “Next Step”
The “Next Step” button must be DISABLED by default and only enabled when ALL conditions below are true:
- The proposal has AT LEAST 3 clients (members).
- ALL mandatory fields of ALL required form pages are completed for ALL clients in the proposal.
- Mandatory pages include:
  - Loan Details
  - Personal Data
  - Business Data
  - Financials (P&L)
- If any mandatory field is missing for any client, the button remains disabled.

3) Mandatory field validation on navigation
- Mandatory fields must be validated not only on submit, but also when:
  - The user leaves a form page (switches tabs), AND
  - The user returns to a form page.
- When returning to a page, any mandatory field not filled must:
  - Be visually marked as incomplete
  - Show a clear inline message (e.g., “Required field”)
- Do not wait for “Next Step” click to show missing fields.

4) Page-level completion indicator (per form page)
- Each form page (Loan Details, Personal Data, Business Data, Financials) must show a completion indicator.
- The indicator represents:
  - Denominator: total number of mandatory fields on that page.
  - Numerator: number of mandatory fields on that page that are filled.
- Display as a percentage (e.g., “Personal Data 40% complete”).
- Place the indicator near the page/tab title (e.g., small progress ring, bar, or badge).
- Update the indicator live as fields are filled.

5) Client-level completion indicator (per member)
- Next to each CLIENT name (member tab), display an overall completion indicator.
- Calculation:
  - Denominator: total number of mandatory fields across ALL pages for that client.
  - Numerator: total number of mandatory fields filled across ALL pages for that client.
- Example:
  - Personal Data: 10 required
  - Loan Details: 7 required
  - Business Data: 13 required
  - Financials: 10 required
  - Total = 40 required fields
  - If client filled 4 fields in Personal Data only:
    - Personal Data page indicator = 40%
    - Other pages = 0%
    - Client overall indicator = 10%
- Update client indicator live as fields are filled.

6) Visual design guidance (you may propose a creative solution)
- Completion indicators must be compact and readable on tablet.
- Acceptable patterns:
  - Circular progress ring with percentage inside
  - Thin progress bar + percentage label
  - Badge-style percentage chip
- Page-level indicators should be subtle.
- Client-level indicators should be more visible but not overpower the name.
- Use existing app color palette (primary blue + neutral grays).
- Avoid red/yellow unless indicating errors.

7) Data & architecture requirements
- Define a single source of truth for:
  - Mandatory fields per page
  - Mandatory fields per client
- Implement reusable helper functions:
  - getPageCompletion(memberId, pageType)
  - getMemberCompletion(memberId)
  - isProposalComplete(proposal)
- Do NOT hardcode percentages in the UI.
- Completion must be derived from actual proposal data in the store.

8) Acceptance criteria
- “Next Step” only enables when proposal has ≥3 clients and all mandatory fields are filled for all clients.
- Switching pages shows missing required fields immediately.
- Each page shows its own completion percentage.
- Each client tab shows an overall completion percentage.
- Submitting via “Next Step” moves proposal into approval flow (Under Evaluation).
- No regression to Save & Exit behavior.
