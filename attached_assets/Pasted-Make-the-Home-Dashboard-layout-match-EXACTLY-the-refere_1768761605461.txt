Make the Home/Dashboard layout match EXACTLY the reference screenshot provided (cards aligned, pipeline in one row with 5 smaller cards, no horizontal scroll). Update only layout/styling; do not change data logic or navigation.

1) Target file
- Home/Dashboard page component (the page that renders “Dashboard” and “Pipeline Overview”).

2) Page header row (top of content)
- Left: Title “Dashboard” and subtitle “Here’s what’s happening with your portfolio today.”
- Right: Primary button “+ New Proposal” aligned horizontally with the title area (same row).
- Keep the top app header (logo, search, agent) unchanged.

3) KPI cards row (3 cards)
- Keep 3 KPI cards in a single row.
- Use equal widths, same height, same spacing.
- Ensure the cards and the Pipeline section below share the same left/right gutters (same container width and padding).

4) Pipeline Overview section (the important part)
- Title “Pipeline Overview” with a small vertical accent bar to the left (yellow/orange) exactly like the screenshot.
- Under the title, render FIVE pipeline cards in a single row:
  - On Going
  - Under Eval
  - Completed
  - Renewals
  - Collections
- Absolutely no horizontal scrolling/dragging. All 5 must fit on the tablet width.
- Cards must be smaller than KPI cards and consistent size across all 5.
- Use a 5-column grid for the pipeline cards: grid-cols-5.
- Use a moderate gap similar to screenshot (not huge).

5) Pipeline card internal layout (match screenshot)
Each pipeline card must have:
- Top-left: rounded icon container with the stage icon inside.
- Top-right: large count number (bold).
- Middle-left: stage title (bold).
- Bottom-left: “View details” link in the stage color.
- Bottom-right: small chevron arrow aligned with the “View details” row.
- Card background should be a very light tint matching each stage (blue/yellow/green/purple/red).
- Card border radius and shadow subtle, consistent with KPI cards.

6) Exact sizing guidance (use Tailwind)
- Wrap the whole page content in the same container used for KPIs:
  - max width centered with consistent horizontal padding (reuse existing container classes from KPI section).
- Pipeline grid:
  - className should be like: "grid grid-cols-5 gap-6"
- Pipeline card size:
  - Reduce padding to p-5 (or p-4 if needed to fit).
  - Ensure no min-width is applied.
  - Ensure the count uses a large font but does not overflow (e.g., text-4xl).
  - Ensure “View details” is small (e.g., text-sm) and stays on one line.

7) Remove any previous horizontal-scroll implementation
- Remove flex + overflow-x-auto wrappers and any min-w-[...] wrappers around pipeline cards.
- The pipeline section must be purely grid-based.

8) Final acceptance criteria (must pass)
- The Pipeline Overview shows all five cards on one row without scrolling.
- The pipeline row aligns perfectly with the KPI cards above (same left/right margins).
- Card sizes and spacing visually match the screenshot: smaller pipeline cards, larger KPI cards.
- “+ New Proposal” button is on the right of the Dashboard header row.
- No behavior changes: clicking “View details” still navigates correctly.
