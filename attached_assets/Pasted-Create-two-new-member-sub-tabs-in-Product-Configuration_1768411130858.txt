Create two new member sub-tabs in Product Configuration: “Business Data” and “Financials (P&L)”, based on the fields in Artemis Loan Form.xlsx.

UI placement

In the member sub-tabs (currently Loan Details and Personal Data), add two new tabs:

Business Data

Financials (P&L)

Keep tablet-first spacing consistent with existing tabs.

Tabs must not reorder when data changes.

Data model + persistence

Extend the proposal store Member model to include:

member.businessData: object with all Business Data fields

member.pnl: object with all Business P&L fields

Ensure Save & Exit persists these objects and reopening from “On Going” restores values.

Use stable keys (camelCase) and do not break existing stored proposals (provide defaults when missing).

Business Data tab fields + rules (per member)

Required fields:

businessName (text)

businessType (select list) and if businessType == “Other” show otherBusinessType (text, optional)

businessSector (select list)

multipleBusiness (boolean toggle)

openingMonth (select list of 12 months)

openingYear (number, 4 digits)

businessAddress1 (text)

businessAddress2 (text) IMPORTANT: make optional even if spreadsheet shows mandatory

state (US states select list, reuse existing state list from Personal Data)

city (text)

zipCode (numeric)

contact1Type (select list, reuse contact types from Personal Data)

businessContact1 (numeric)

Conditional fields:

If multipleBusiness is true, show Business 2 and Business 3 blocks:

businessName2, businessType2, businessSector2 (all optional)

businessName3, businessType3, businessSector3 (all optional)

Contact 2 fields optional: contact2Type, businessContact2

Validation:

On Save & Exit, validate required fields; show inline errors; block save until fixed.

Text rules consistent with Personal Data name rules where applicable (no leading spaces; allow accents; no numbers only for name-like fields).

Financials (P&L) tab fields + rules (per member)

Editable numeric inputs (required):

earningsMonthly

monthlySales1

operationalCostsMonthlyTotal

personalExpensesMonthlyTotal

Editable numeric inputs (optional):

monthlySales2, monthlySales3, receivablesFactoring, extraIncome, deductions

payroll, sga, facilitiesRent, cogs, investmentsCapex, operationalOther

financialCostsMonthly, shortTermLoans, longTermLoans, accountsPayable

homeRent, clothing, nutrition, water, power, education, subscriptions, transportation, personalOther

savings, monthlySavings, totalSavings

financialDebts

institution1Name + institution1Amount, institution2Name + institution2Amount, institution3Name + institution3Amount

Calculated read-only fields (still displayed because spreadsheet lists them as required):

netRevenueMonthly = (earningsMonthly + monthlySales1 + monthlySales2 + monthlySales3 + receivablesFactoring + extraIncome) - deductions

grossProfitMonthly = netRevenueMonthly - operationalCostsMonthlyTotal

businessNetProfitMonthly = grossProfitMonthly - financialCostsMonthly

annualRevenue = netRevenueMonthly * 12

annualExpenses = (operationalCostsMonthlyTotal + personalExpensesMonthlyTotal) * 12

operationalMargin = if netRevenueMonthly > 0 then businessNetProfitMonthly / netRevenueMonthly else 0 (display as %)

familyExpenses = personalExpensesMonthlyTotal (until a different definition exists)

paymentCapacity = businessNetProfitMonthly - personalExpensesMonthlyTotal

Validation:

Required numeric fields must be present and >= 0.

Optional numeric fields default to 0 when empty for calculations.

Inline errors; block Save & Exit if required inputs invalid.

Reuse existing components

Reuse the same numeric/currency input behavior used in Loan Details.

Reuse existing Select components and styles.

Files

If the codebase already has per-tab components, create:

client/src/components/productConfig/BusinessDataTab.tsx

client/src/components/productConfig/PnLTab.tsx

Otherwise implement inside the existing ProductConfigScreen member tab content in a clean way (no giant file growth).

Update ProductConfigScreen to render the two new tabs and wire them to the proposal store.

Deliver working UI + persistence, with validation consistent with Loan Details and Personal Data, and no regressions in existing flows.
