Implement a full “Evidence & Photos” system in Artemis Hunting MVP (Product Configuration) with BOTH contextual capture (inside each form page) AND a centralized Evidence Hub accessible anytime. Photos are per-client (per member) and must count as required fields for completion and for enabling Next Step.

1) Core requirements
- Photos are stored per member (client). Each member has their own evidence set.
- Some photos are mandatory, some optional, some conditional based on Loan Details (loan goal/type).
- Evidence must affect completion percentages:
  - Member completion
  - Page completion
  - Proposal completion
  - Next Step enablement

2) Evidence types (per member)
Create an evidence schema with these items (use stable keys):
A) Mandatory for every member
- clientSelfie (photo of client)
- idFront (document front)
- idBack (document back)
- businessProofOfAddress (proof of address for business) REQUIRED (can be same file as residence proof, but still required as a field)
- businessPhoto (photo of the establishment) REQUIRED

B) Optional (not required for completion)
- residenceProofOfAddress (proof of residence) OPTIONAL by default
- inventoryPhoto (photo of inventory) OPTIONAL
- utilityBillElectricity (electric bill) OPTIONAL
- utilityBillWater (water bill) OPTIONAL

C) Conditional (required only for certain loan goal/type)
- renovationPhoto REQUIRED only when loan purpose corresponds to renovation (check existing Loan Details “Loan goal” / “Loan type” options and match the one used for renovation/investment)
- newMachineryPhoto REQUIRED only when loan purpose corresponds to buying machinery/equipment (match the relevant option in Loan Details)
If the loan goal/type is not renovation, renovationPhoto must be optional/hidden and must NOT block completion.
If the loan goal/type is not machinery/equipment, newMachineryPhoto must be optional/hidden and must NOT block completion.

3) Data model & persistence
- Extend Member model to include:
  member.evidence = {
    clientSelfie: { uri, capturedAt } | null,
    idFront: { uri, capturedAt } | null,
    idBack: { uri, capturedAt } | null,
    residenceProofOfAddress: { uri, capturedAt } | null,
    businessProofOfAddress: { uri, capturedAt } | null,
    businessPhoto: { uri, capturedAt } | null,
    inventoryPhoto: { uri, capturedAt } | null,
    renovationPhoto: { uri, capturedAt } | null,
    newMachineryPhoto: { uri, capturedAt } | null,
    utilityBillElectricity: { uri, capturedAt } | null,
    utilityBillWater: { uri, capturedAt } | null
  }
- Persist evidence in the same proposal store persistence used by Save & Exit so it survives refresh and appears on On Going.

4) Central Evidence Hub (global, per proposal)
- Add a button in the Product Configuration header area (top dark header) OR near the member tabs:
  Label: “Evidence & Photos”
  Show a small badge count of missing required evidence for the active member and/or whole proposal.
- Clicking opens a modal or full-screen panel (tablet-friendly) with:
  - Member selector (tabs or dropdown) to switch between members
  - For the selected member, show a checklist grouped by sections:
    1) Client identity
       - Client photo (required)
       - ID front (required)
