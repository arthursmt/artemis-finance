Implement a full “Evidence & Photos” system in Artemis Hunting MVP (Product Configuration) with BOTH contextual capture (inside each form page) AND a centralized Evidence Hub accessible anytime. Photos are per-client (per member) and must count as required fields for completion and for enabling Next Step.

1) Core requirements
- Photos are stored per member (client). Each member has their own evidence set.
- Some photos are mandatory, some optional, some conditional based on Loan Details (loan goal/type).
- Evidence must affect completion percentages:
  - Member completion
  - Page completion
  - Proposal completion
  - Next Step enablement

2) Evidence types (per member)
Create an evidence schema with these items (use stable keys):
A) Mandatory for every member
- clientSelfie (photo of client)
- idFront (document front)
- idBack (document back)
- businessProofOfAddress (proof of address for business) REQUIRED (can be same file as residence proof, but still required as a field)
- businessPhoto (photo of the establishment) REQUIRED

B) Optional (not required for completion)
- residenceProofOfAddress (proof of residence) OPTIONAL by default
- inventoryPhoto (photo of inventory) OPTIONAL
- utilityBillElectricity (electric bill) OPTIONAL
- utilityBillWater (water bill) OPTIONAL

C) Conditional (required only for certain loan goal/type)
- renovationPhoto REQUIRED only when loan purpose corresponds to renovation (check existing Loan Details “Loan goal” / “Loan type” options and match the one used for renovation/investment)
- newMachineryPhoto REQUIRED only when loan purpose corresponds to buying machinery/equipment (match the relevant option in Loan Details)
If the loan goal/type is not renovation, renovationPhoto must be optional/hidden and must NOT block completion.
If the loan goal/type is not machinery/equipment, newMachineryPhoto must be optional/hidden and must NOT block completion.

3) Data model & persistence
- Extend Member model to include:
  member.evidence = {
    clientSelfie: { uri, capturedAt } | null,
    idFront: { uri, capturedAt } | null,
    idBack: { uri, capturedAt } | null,
    residenceProofOfAddress: { uri, capturedAt } | null,
    businessProofOfAddress: { uri, capturedAt } | null,
    businessPhoto: { uri, capturedAt } | null,
    inventoryPhoto: { uri, capturedAt } | null,
    renovationPhoto: { uri, capturedAt } | null,
    newMachineryPhoto: { uri, capturedAt } | null,
    utilityBillElectricity: { uri, capturedAt } | null,
    utilityBillWater: { uri, capturedAt } | null
  }
- Persist evidence in the same proposal store persistence used by Save & Exit so it survives refresh and appears on On Going.

4) Central Evidence Hub (global, per proposal)
- Add a button in the Product Configuration header area (top dark header) OR near the member tabs:
  Label: “Evidence & Photos”
  Show a small badge count of missing required evidence for the active member and/or whole proposal.
- Clicking opens a modal or full-screen panel (tablet-friendly) with:
  - Member selector (tabs or dropdown) to switch between members
  - For the selected member, show a checklist grouped by sections:
    1) Client identity
       - Client photo (required)
       - ID front (required)
       - ID back (required)
       - Residence proof (optional)
    2) Business existence
       - Business photo (required)
       - Business proof of address (required)
       - Inventory photo (optional)
       - Electricity bill (optional)
       - Water bill (optional)
    3) Conditional photos (only show when required by loan goal/type)
       - Renovation photo (conditional)
       - New machinery photo (conditional)
  - Each item shows:
    - Status pill: Missing / Completed / Optional
    - Thumbnail preview if present
    - Buttons: “Capture/Upload” if missing, “Retake” if present, “View” if present
- IMPORTANT: Selecting an evidence item should open the capture/upload flow and store the image for that member and that evidence key.

5) Contextual capture inside form pages (primary capture)
Add small “Required photos” blocks inside relevant pages:
A) Personal Data page: show a compact card titled “Client Photos”
- Client photo (required)
- ID front (required)
- ID back (required)
- Residence proof (optional)
Each item has a small status indicator and a Capture/Retake button.
This must update member.evidence immediately.

B) Business Data page: show a compact card titled “Business Photos”
- Business photo (required)
- Business proof of address (required)
- Inventory photo (optional)
- Electricity bill (optional)
- Water bill (optional)
Also include the conditional photos block here (or in Loan Details):
- Renovation photo (conditional)
- New machinery photo (conditional)
Only display these when the loan goal/type implies they are required.

C) Loan Details page: if easier, you may place the conditional photo prompts here because loan goal is configured here.
- When user selects the loan goal/type that triggers conditional photos, show an inline prompt telling them which extra photo will be required and provide a shortcut button “Go to Evidence”.

6) Capture/upload behavior (web MVP)
- Since this is a web React app, implement file input upload as the MVP capture mechanism:
  - “Capture/Upload” opens file picker
  - Accept images only
  - Create a preview thumbnail
  - Store as data URL or stored file reference (use the existing storage approach in the app; simplest is base64/dataURL in local storage for MVP)
- Provide “Retake” which replaces the stored image.

7) Required evidence rules for completion
- Evidence items count as required fields for completion calculations and Next Step gating.
- Required evidence per member includes:
  - clientSelfie, idFront, idBack, businessProofOfAddress, businessPhoto
  - plus renovationPhoto if renovation goal applies
  - plus newMachineryPhoto if machinery/equipment goal applies
- Optional evidence never blocks completion and does not count in required denominator.

8) Completion calculations updates
- Update the existing completion functions so that evidence required fields are included:
  - Page completion:
    - Personal Data page denominator includes required personal fields + required evidence items shown on that page
    - Business Data page denominator includes required business fields + required evidence items shown on that page
  - Member completion denominator includes all required fields across all pages + required evidence items (including conditional ones when applicable)
  - Proposal completion denominator uses the member denominators (respect the “minimum 3 clients” rule already specified)
- Ensure the completion shown on:
  - Product Config member tabs
  - Product Config page tabs
  - On Going list
  stays consistent with the same logic.

9) Next Step gating
- Next Step must remain disabled unless:
  - Proposal has at least 3 members
  - ALL required fields AND ALL required evidence for ALL members are completed
- If disabled, show a helpful message:
  - “Complete all required fields and photos for all members to submit.”
  - Provide a “View missing items” link that opens the Evidence Hub filtered to missing required items.

10) Acceptance criteria
- Each member has independent evidence; capturing for Member 3 does not affect Member 1.
- Evidence Hub shows accurate checklist statuses and thumbnails.
- Contextual photo blocks appear on Personal Data and Business Data pages with correct required/optional items.
- Conditional photos appear only when the loan goal/type requires them and then become required for completion.
- Completion percentages update immediately when photos are added.
- Luci Machado proposal can reach 100% only when required photos are provided for all members.
- Save & Exit persists evidence and completion state; On Going shows correct percentage.
