Update the On Going Proposals screen to remove the redundant “Status” column and replace it with a “Completion” indicator (percentage). Sort proposals by completion from most complete to least complete. Reorder table columns and improve Actions column alignment.

1) Target screen / file
- Update the screen for route /ongoing (On Going Proposals). Find the table that currently shows columns: Client Name, Amount, Date Created, Status, Actions.

2) Remove redundant Status
- Remove the “Status” column entirely (header and cells). This screen is already filtered to On Going proposals, so status is redundant.

3) Add Completion percentage column (2nd column)
- Add a new column called “Completion” as the SECOND column (right after Client Name).
- Completion cell should show:
  - A compact progress bar (thin, tablet-friendly) AND a percentage label (e.g., “72%”).
  - If you already have a Progress component, reuse it. Otherwise implement a simple div-based bar.
- Completion must be computed per proposal based on how much of the proposal data is filled.

4) Completion calculation (MVP, deterministic)
- Implement a getProposalCompletion(proposal) function that returns an integer 0–100.
- Use a weighted checklist based on the proposal store structure. Do NOT guess randomly; use existing data fields.
- Minimal recommended checklist (adjust to actual available fields in the proposal object):
  A) Prospecting / group basics (25%)
    - leader firstName and lastName present
    - loanAmount present and within valid range
    - at least 1 member exists
  B) Validation step done (25%)
    - proposal has validation results for each member OR a flag that validation completed
  C) Product Config - Loan Details (25%)
    - for each member: loanDetails has required fields (installments, firstPaymentDate, loanType, loanGoal (and otherGoal if needed), insurance selection)
  D) Product Config - Personal Data (25%)
    - for each member: required personal fields present (firstName, lastName, documentType, documentId, countryOfOrigin, birthDate, address1, state, city, zip, contact1Type, contact1Number)
- For group proposals: compute per-member completion for C and D and average across members.
- If some modules/fields do not exist yet in the store, score that module as 0, but keep the function stable and based on what exists.

5) Sorting
- Sort proposals descending by completion percentage (highest first).
- If two proposals have the same completion, secondary sort by most recently created (newest first).

6) Column order changes (final table columns)
- Columns must be in this exact order:
  1. Client Name
  2. Completion
  3. Amount
  4. Actions
  5. Created Date (last column)
- Rename “Date Created” to a grammatically correct label:
  - Use “Created Date” (simple and correct) OR “Created On”.
  - Do NOT use “Begin Date” (ambiguous).
- Ensure the date value formatting stays the same as current.

7) Actions column alignment
- Center-align the Actions header and all cells in the Actions column.
- The buttons/links inside Actions must be visually centered as a group within the column.
- Keep existing actions (Keep filling, View details, Delete) and their behavior unchanged.

8) Acceptance checks
- No “Status” column exists.
- Completion column appears as second column with progress + %.
- Proposals are ordered from highest completion to lowest.
- Column order matches the requirement and Created Date is the last column.
- Actions column header and content are centered.
