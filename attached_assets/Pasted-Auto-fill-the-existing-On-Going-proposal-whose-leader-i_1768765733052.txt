Auto-fill the existing On Going proposal whose leader is “Luci Machado” with realistic random data so that it becomes 100% complete according to the current completion logic, and therefore shows 100% on the /ongoing list.

1) Identify the target proposal
- Find the proposal in the proposal store where the leader/member[0] display name is “Luci Machado”.
- Use its proposalId and ensure we update THAT exact proposal.

2) Ensure minimum group size for completion base
- If the proposal currently has fewer than 3 members, automatically add members until it has exactly 3.
- If it has 3 or more members already, do not remove members.

3) Fill ALL required fields for ALL members (3+)
For EACH member, populate all required fields across all pages:
A) Loan Details (required)
- loanValue: set to a valid amount within min/max (e.g., 5,500)
- loanType: Working capital (or another valid option)
- installments: valid selection (e.g., 6 or 9)
- firstPaymentDate: a valid date <= 60 days from today AND day-of-month between 1 and 15 inclusive
- loanGoal: valid selection (if “Other”, also fill otherGoal)
- borrowerInsurance: true (or a valid default)
- optional insurances: choose valid values (None is allowed unless your required logic needs a selection)
- Ensure any dependent/calculated fields are satisfied by the chosen inputs

B) Personal Data (required)
- firstName, lastName (letters/spaces only)
- documentType and documentId (valid)
- countryOfOrigin (valid selection)
- birthDate (valid date)
- homeAddress1
- state, city, zipCode (zip numeric)
- contact1Type and contact1Number (numeric)
- Ensure no required field is left empty

C) Business Data (required)
- businessName
- businessType (if “Other”, fill otherBusinessType)
- businessSector
- openingMonth and openingYear (4-digit)
- businessAddress1
- state, city, zip
- contact1Type and businessContact1
- multipleBusinesses: can be false to keep it simple

D) Financials (P&L) required inputs
- Fill all required P&L inputs according to the current implementation:
  - earningsMonthly
  - monthlySales1
  - operationalCostsMonthlyTotal
  - personalExpensesMonthlyTotal
- If your completion logic also treats additional calculated fields as required, ensure they are computed and present.

4) Use random-but-realistic values
- Generate different names for members 2 and 3 (do not overwrite Luci Machado for the leader).
- Use realistic addresses (can be mock), realistic dates, numeric values that look plausible.
- Ensure all validations pass (no out-of-range, no invalid date rules, no empty required fields).

5) Where to implement this auto-fill
- Add a development-only helper in the app (do not expose in production UI):
  Option A (preferred): Add a temporary “Dev: Auto-fill Luci Machado” button visible only in development mode (e.g., process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") on either:
  - /ongoing row actions for Luci Machado, OR
  - Product Configuration header for that proposal
  Clicking it runs the autofill and persists the proposal.
  Option B: Run autofill automatically once on app load in development if the proposal exists and is not complete (guard so it runs only once).

6) After autofill
- Persist the updated proposal to the same storage used by Save & Exit so it survives refresh.
- Navigate to /ongoing and verify the Luci Machado proposal shows 100% completion.
- Verify inside Product Configuration:
  - Each member shows 100% completion
  - Each page shows 100% completion

7) Acceptance criteria
- Luci Machado proposal appears as 100% on the On Going list without manual typing.
- All required fields across all required pages are filled for all members (at least 3).
- No validation errors are triggered by the random data.
- The autofill is clearly development-only and does not affect production behavior.
